TODOs:
clone the repo and add file locally (the parse .exe file, etc)

(do this first before adding any files for the project)
delete nearly all the files created by fastpages, since we just don't need that

Or, just do this in another repo

To summarize, after adding files (should include index.html/.md ?), click setting ->
navigate to page -> at Github Pages, select a branch to host online, and just wait for it
EZ (indeed really easy)
Remember to add '/' at the end of url: xxx.github.io/projectname/
